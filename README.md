## Announcements

### New GitHub Repo

We'll be moving Revel to its own GitHub Organization very soon to allow the core developers
to better contribute to Revel and its community. The old repo should redirect to the new
repo as soon as we make the move, but it will introduce `go get` issues for existing
projects.

So be warned, you will need to make adjustments, but we feel it will be worth
it in the long run!

### v1.0 Goal

You'll notice that our next planned milestone release is v0.10 and you may wonder if Revel is
production-ready. The short answer is yes. However, the team feels that there are still some
features needed before we can make a whole-hearted endorsement of Revel as a true "batteries-included" web framework.

For those of you new to Go or Revel, we'd like to invite you to join us on our march to v1.0
and help make Revel a stable, secure and enjoyable web framework.

We'd like to take this opportunity to thank the entire community for their feedback and
regular contributions. Your support has been very encouraging and highly appreciated.
